Project: üè¢üè¢Term Deposit Conversion Prediction

Goal: Identify bank customers most likely to convert to a term deposit and target them with personalized calls to increase deposit sales.

Data:

Customer demographic information (age, income, occupation, etc.)

Account details (account type, balance, transaction history)

Past term deposit holdings (if available)

Marketing campaign interactions (if applicable)


‚ú®Approach:


Data Preprocessing:

Clean and handle missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, deletion).

Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

Feature scaling or normalization may be necessary depending on the chosen algorithm.


Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might be more predictive of term deposit conversion (e.g., average balance, transaction frequency, time since last term deposit).

Feature selection techniques can be used to identify the most relevant features.


‚ú®Model Selection and Training:


Consider a variety of classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression (baseline model, interpretable)

Random Forest (robust, handles complex relationships)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) (effective for high-dimensional data)

Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
Use cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability.


Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve for imbalanced datasets.

Choose the model with the best balance of these metrics for your specific business goals.


Deployment and Call Targeting:

Integrate the model into a production environment to score new customer data.

Set a threshold to identify customers most likely to convert (e.g., top 20% or based on cost-benefit analysis).

Prioritize these high-potential customers for personalized call campaigns, tailoring the communication to their needs and past interactions.


‚ú®Additional Considerations:


Model Interpretability: 

If explaining model predictions is important, consider using interpretable models like Logistic Regression or decision trees. You can also employ techniques like LIME or SHAP to understand feature contributions.


Data Privacy:

Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations when collecting and using customer data.

Monitoring and Retraining: Monitor model performance over time and retrain as needed to maintain accuracy with changing customer behavior or market conditions.


Expected Benefits:

Increased term deposit sales through targeted marketing efforts.

Improved customer engagement and satisfaction with personalized communication.

Potential for cross-selling other bank products based on customer profiles.


Next Steps:

Refine the data collection and pre-processing process.

Experiment with advanced feature engineering techniques.
